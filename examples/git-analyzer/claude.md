# claude.md - Project Rules for git-analyzer

## Project Overview

**Type**: cli
**Goal**: Analyze git repositories to provide insights on code quality, contributor activity, and project health
**Language**: python

## Code Standards

### Style
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use ruff for formatting
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Type Safety
- Use type hints on all functions
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- Document complex types with comments

### Testing
- Minimum test coverage: 85%
- Write tests before implementation (TDD encouraged)
- Use descriptive test names: `test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected>`

### Documentation
- All public functions must have docstrings
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Keep README.md up to date

## Git Workflow

### Branching
- Branch from `main` for each task
- Format: `feature/<phase>-<task>-<description>`
- Example: `feature/1-2-commit-analysis`

### Commits
- Use semantic commit messages
- Format: `<type>: <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore

### Pull Requests
- Squash merge to main
- Include task ID in PR title
- Ensure CI passes before merge

## Quality Gates

Before marking a task complete:
1. All tests pass
2. Linting passes with no warnings
3. Type checking passes
4. Code reviewed (self-review acceptable for solo dev)
5. Documentation updated if needed
