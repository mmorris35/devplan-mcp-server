# 2026-02-13 - DevPlan Bug Fixes Session

## Summary
Working through batch of bugs from testing (#137-#143, #146). PR #144 merged with 7 fixes.

## Completed Today
- PR #144 merged: #130, #125, #126, #137, #138, #141 fixes
- Branch `fix/feature-grouping-146` created - fixes feature grouping regression
- #146 root cause: `groupRelatedFeatures` only pushed groups that had items (endpoints), but features without endpoints are valid phases too

## Active Work
- **Branch:** `fix/feature-grouping-146` (builds pass, ready for PR)
- **Remaining bugs:** #139, #140, #142

## Bug Analysis
### #139 - CLAUDE.md ignores detected language
- `getLanguageDefaults` imported at line 12, called at line 222
- Language param passed but defaults not applied correctly
- Need to trace how language flows through generator pipeline

### #140 - Nonsensical file paths
- `.txt` extensions, Python naming conventions for Java projects
- Same root cause as #139 - language defaults not propagating

### #142 - Irrelevant lessons in plans
- Graph API/Cargo/RocksDB lessons appearing in Java plans
- Decision: Infer language from lesson content rather than add `languages` field

## Key Files
- `src/generators.ts` - main plan generation logic
- `src/language-defaults.ts` - language-specific defaults
- `src/adapters/claude.ts` - CLAUDE.md generator
- `src/templates.ts` - template system

## Next Session
1. Create PR for #146 fix
2. Fix language propagation in generators (#139, #140)
3. Filter lessons by inferred language (#142)
