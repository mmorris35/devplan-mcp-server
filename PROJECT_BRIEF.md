# PROJECT_BRIEF.md

## Basic Information

- **Project Name**: DevPlan MCP Server
- **Project Type**: api
- **Primary Goal**: MCP server that transforms project ideas into paint-by-numbers development plans executable by AI coding assistants
- **Target Users**: Claude Code users, AI-assisted developers, Development teams using AI coding tools
- **Timeline**: Ongoing development
- **Team Size**: 1+

## Functional Requirements

### Key Features (MVP - Implemented)

- Generate Haiku-executable development plans from project briefs
- Built-in plan validation and verification
- Lessons learned system for continuous improvement
- GitHub issue to remediation task conversion
- Executor and Verifier agent generation
- Visual workflow export (Mermaid, ReactFlow)
- Claude Code Task tools integration

### Nice-to-Have Features (v2)

- Multi-model agent support (Cursor, Aider, Cline, Windsurf, Generic)
- Template customization and extension system
- Community adapter contributions
- Model-specific verbosity tuning

## Technical Constraints

### Must Use

- TypeScript
- Cloudflare Workers (Wrangler)
- SSE transport for MCP
- Vitest for testing

### Cannot Use

- Server-side databases (use KV for persistence)
- Long-running processes (serverless constraints)

## Other Constraints

- Plans must be Haiku-executable (mechanical implementation without interpretation)
- Backward compatibility required for existing users
- Must work with Claude Code's native MCP integration

## Success Criteria

- All MVP features implemented and working
- Code passes linting and type checking
- Test coverage >= 80%
- Documentation complete
- Plans successfully executed by Haiku model
